## React.js Single Page App Coffe Shop

# Project Short Description 
- To run the broject use `npm start`
- I used React Router to make the website in a single page so it would be easy to use
- I used React Swiper to make responsive sliders to contain items
- I created a function for each component to automatically add id for each item so the item
cannot be duplicated in the cart
